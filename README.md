Building a React Location Search Application with Google Place Autocomplete and Redux

Objective:
Design a React application that allows users to find places using Google Place 
Autocomplete and displays search results on a map. The application must utilize Redux 
to store and manage search results, and you can choose one of the following methods 
in combination with Redux: Redux Thunk, Redux Promise, Redux Saga, or Redux-Observable
 Epics. The UI should be implemented using Material Design Kit for a simple and user-
friendly experience.

Requirements:

Google Place Autocomplete:

Implement a textbox with autocomplete functionality using the Google Place 
Autocomplete API (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete).
Fetch and display results based on user input.
Redux Integration:

Utilize Redux for state management.
Store and manage search results using one of the following methods: Redux Thunk,
 Redux Promise, Redux Saga, or Redux-Observable Epics.
Display Search History:

Display all searches that the user has tried.
Leverage Redux to store and manage the search history.
Material Design UI:

Use the Material Design Kit (https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) for building the 
UI.
Create a simple and user-friendly interface, showcasing your creativity as a Front-
end developer.
Code Structure:

Implement a scalable code structure using ES6 features.
Use High Order Components (HOC) where necessary for code reusability.
Functional Programming:

Apply great functional programming practices throughout the codebase to enhance 
maintainability and readability.
Redux-Observable Epic:

If you choose Redux-Observable, implement epics to handle complex asynchronous 
actions in a scalable way.
Additional Considerations:

Scalability:

Design the codebase in a way that it is scalable for potential future enhancements.
ESLint:

Use ESLint for static code analysis to maintain code quality.
Testing:

Implement unit tests to validate the functionality of key components, actions, and 
reducers.
Documentation:

Provide clear documentation for setting up the project, running the application, and 
any other relevant details.
Code Comments:

Add comments in the code to explain complex logic or any crucial implementation 
details.
Delivery:
Submit the React codebase along with any necessary setup instructions, documentation, 
and a brief overview of the implemented features. The goal is to demonstrate your 
ability to design a scalable and well-structured React project with Google Place 
Autocomplete and Redux integration.
